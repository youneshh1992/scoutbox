/**
 * The data layer: real tables in the same SQLite file as the snapshot store,
 * one domain at a time. `attachDataLayer` runs the table migrations, attaches
 * each domain repository, and replaces that domain's `db.<collection>` with
 * the repository's read-only view. Everything else in `db` is still the blob
 * snapshot until its domain moves here.
 *
 * LIVE tables, owned by repositories (docs/architecture/sqlite-migration-plan.md):
 *   org_users (step S0), sessions (S2, hashed tokens), orgs (S3), and since
 *   S4a players, guardians and guardian_children (repositories/identity.mjs,
 *   migration 0005). Writes go through the repositories and the blobs are
 *   never written again. The S1 shadow projection is retired: every table it
 *   shadowed is live, so there is nothing left to project or to validate.
 *   media_deletions (migration 0006) is the crash-safe queue of media files
 *   to remove after a player deletion commits (repositories/mediaDeletions.mjs).
 *
 * Order at boot (server.mjs): seed → loadSnapshot → snapshot migrations →
 * attachDataLayer → module registration → listen. A migrated collection is
 * therefore a plain array (seed or legacy blob) while the snapshot migrations
 * run, and a repository view from this point on. Inside attachDataLayer the
 * order is organisations → identity (guardians before players: the FK) →
 * staff → sessions, so every repository that references another finds its
 * rows in place on a first installation.
 *
 * This directory is `repositories/`, not `data/`: `data/` is the server's
 * runtime data directory (DATA_DIR), which tests delete between runs.
